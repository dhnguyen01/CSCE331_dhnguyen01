                Over the summer, I had the amazing opportunity to work as a counselor
                at Sky Ranch. It was a rewarding experience working with kids and
                being part of an incredible team.

            <p>
                I also had the privilege to perform with the wind symphony in Spain.
                It was an unforgettable experience playing music in such beautiful and
                historic locations.

                While at Sky Ranch, I also had the chance to explore nature and
                encounter wildlife, like this turtle!

                During the summer, I was also involved in Impact Retreat, where we
                helped incoming freshmen get acclimated and excited for the upcoming
                school year at Texas A&M.

                This is a group photo of all the amazing people I got to work with at

                <p>
                    Create an HTML file showcasing what I'm involved in. I've attached
                    some photos of what I did over the summer and what I'm involved in.
                    Include them in the html. I'm leaving the rest of it up to you. Be
                    creative. Add some animations as well. Choose a fun color palette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like the initial animations, but it needs much more styling. Can
                    you add a lot more styling to make it more visually appealing?
                </p>
                <p>Add a text box that has all the prompts I used to create this</p>
                <p>
                    Now show off to front end designers with what you can do. Make it
                    flashier and do a lot of showing off with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now take it a step even further with extreme attention to detail and eye-catching design elements. Push the limits all the way with modern front-end design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website needs to show off even more front-end design capabilities and impressive effects. This isn't even scratching the surface. Think about some of the best front-end designers' personal portfolios. This should exceed even that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now fine-tune this, surpassing even this with extreme attention to detail and functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually want you to create more of a barebones HTML file that we can style later with CSS and JS. Include anything necessary that may be needed later with professional style.
