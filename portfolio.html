              In this recent project, I created a JavaFX application that
              simulates Wordle. I built this using Java 11 and JavaFX for the
              GUI components and used Maven for project management. I also used
              an MVC design to separate the logic from the UI to keep it
              readable and scalable. Some features I implemented were real-time
              word validation, score tracking, and serialization/deserialization
              of saved game data. The word validation feature checks if the word
              is in the 10,000+ list of guessable words and if the word is the
              correct length. The program also selects a random word from a list
              of over 2,000 potential words. To implement a load/save feature, I
              serialized the game state to a file and deserialized it when the
              app was reopened. This project also taught me front-end design and
              how to create a user-friendly interface.

              A few summers ago, I helped create a full stack web application
              for students to review dining hall menu items to improve mealtime
              decisions and gather community feedback. I worked on the data
              scraping using Puppeteer to get daily menu data from the dining
              hall website to get real-time accuracy of meal information. I also
              utilized MongoDB as a database to store hundreds food items and
              retrieve user reviews, ratings, and menu details. This project is
              currently on hold and hasn't been deployed due to changes on the
              TAMU dining website and may or may not be finished at another
              time.

              When learning about C++ data structures, I implemented
              std::unordered_map to store key-value pairs. I was able to
              implement O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion,
              and search operations using hash functions. I also implemented
              private helper functions and iterators to manage buch indexing,
              node insertion, and element lookup. From there, I create two
              custon hash algorithms, (Polynomial Rolling Hash and FNV-1a) to
              handle collisions and improve data distribution.
