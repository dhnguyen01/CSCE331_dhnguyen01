      <h2>The Bridge Ministries</h2>
      <img src="/images/bridge2.jpg" alt="The Brigde Ministries" />
      <p>
        I am involved in the Beta Upsilon Chi (BYX) fraternity at Texas A&M, and
        our local philanthropy is The Bridge Ministries located in Bryan, TX.
        The Bridge provides boxes of food to approximately 500 families per
        month. I volunteer to help bag food items, check food quality, and help
        with any tasks they might need to have done. In addition, any money BYX
        wins from events goes toward donations to this philanthropy.

      <p>
        BYX's national philanthropy is Living Water International, which is a
        non-profit organzation that helps communities in developing countries to
        create sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene programs in developing
        countries in response to the global water crisis. Our chapter raises
        money for Living Water by hosting Island Party Music Festival.

      <img src="/images/big_event.jpg" alt="The Big Event" />
      <p>
        I have volunteered for The Big Event ever since freshman year to give
        back to the community in Bryan College Station. I help complete service
        projects such as yard work, window washing, and gardening for residents
        of the community.
